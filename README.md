This is a simple Crypto Dashboard app to view some cryptos performance over a 24 hours time period. The design of the app will reflect the performance of the cryptos that are requested. Each crypto card will increase in color intensity the better it gets, or the worse it's doing. This is also responsive web app so it can be viewed on mobile, tablets, and desktops.

All crypto data comes from [CryptoCompare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation)

To run the application locally, clone the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:srowe0091/Crypto-Dashboard.git

cd ./Crypto-Dashboard
```

Then you'll need to install the dependencies with `npm`

`npm i`

Once complete, you can start the development server with

`npm run dev`

To run the production build run this


```bash
npm run build

npm start
```

And that's all it takes!
